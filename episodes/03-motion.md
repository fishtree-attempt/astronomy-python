In the previous episode, we wrote a query to select stars from the
region of the sky where we expect GD-1 to be, and saved the results in
a FITS file.

Now we will read that data back in and implement the next step in the
analysis, identifying stars with the proper motion we expect for GD-1.

## Selecting rows and columns
In the previous episode, we selected spatial and proper motion information from the Gaia catalog for stars around a small part of GD-1. The output was returned as an Astropy `Table`. 
We can use `info` to check the contents.

~~~
polygon_results.info()
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
<Table length=140339>
   name    dtype    unit                              description

      dec float64      deg                                                        Declination

In this episode, we will see operations for selecting columns and rows
from an Astropy `Table`.  You can find more information about these
operations in the [Astropy
documentation](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/table/access_table.html).

We can get the names of the columns like this:

~~~
polygon_results.colnames
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
['source_id', 'ra', 'dec', 'pmra', 'pmdec', 'parallax']
~~~
{: .output}

And select an individual column like this:

~~~
polygon_results['ra']
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
<Column name='ra' dtype='float64' unit='deg' description='Right ascension' length=140339>
142.48301935991023
142.25452941346344

142.26769745823267
142.89551292869012
[Output truncated]
~~~
{: .output}

The result is a `Column` object that contains the data, and also the
data type, units, and name of the column.

~~~
type(polygon_results['ra'])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
astropy.table.column.Column
~~~
{: .output}

The rows in the `Table` are numbered from 0 to `n-1`, where `n` is the
number of rows.  We can select the first row like this:

~~~
polygon_results[0]
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
<Row index=0>
    source_id              ra                dec                pmra              pmdec             parallax

~~~
{: .output}

The result is a `Row` object.

~~~
type(polygon_results[0])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
astropy.table.row.Row
~~~
{: .output}

Notice that the bracket operator can be used to select both columns and rows.  You
might wonder how it knows which to select.
If the expression in brackets is a string, it selects a column; if the
expression is an integer, it selects a row.

If you apply the bracket operator twice, you can select a column and
then an element from the column.

~~~
polygon_results['ra'][0]
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
142.48301935991023
~~~
{: .output}

Or you can select a row and then an element from the row.

~~~
polygon_results[0]['ra']
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
142.48301935991023
~~~
{: .output}

You get the same result either way.

## Scatter plot

To see what the results look like, we will use a scatter plot.  The
library we will use is [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), which is
the most widely-used plotting library for Python.
The Matplotlib interface is based on MATLAB (hence the name), so if
you know MATLAB, some of it will be familiar.

We will import like this:

~~~
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
~~~
{: .language-python}

Pyplot is part of the Matplotlib library.  It is conventional to
import it using the shortened name `plt`.

> ## Keeping plots in the notebook
> In recent versions of Jupyter, plots appear "inline"; that is, they
> are part of the notebook.  In some older versions, plots appear in a
> new window. If your plots appear in a new window, you might want to run the following Jupyter
> [magic command](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#magic-matplotlib)
> in a notebook cell:
> ~~~
> %matplotlib inline
> ~~~
> {: .language-python}
{: .callout}

Pyplot provides two functions that can make scatter plots,
[plt.scatter](https://matplotlib.org/3.3.0/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.scatter.html)
and
[plt.plot](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html).

* `scatter` is more versatile; for example, you can make every point
in a scatter plot a different color.

* `plot` is more limited, but for simple cases, it can be
substantially faster.

Jake Vanderplas explains these differences in [The Python Data Science
Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/04.02-simple-scatter-plots.html).

Since we are plotting more than 100,000 points and they are all the
same size and color, we will use `plot`.

Here is a scatter plot of the stars we selected in the GD-1 region with right ascension on the x-axis and
declination on the y-axis, both ICRS coordinates in degrees.

~~~
x = polygon_results['ra']
y = polygon_results['dec']
plt.plot(x, y, 'ko')

plt.xlabel('ra (degree ICRS)')
plt.ylabel('dec (degree ICRS)')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
<Figure size 432x288 with 1 Axes>
~~~
{: .output}
    
![Scatter plot of right ascension and declination in ICRS coordinates, demonstrating overplotting.](../fig/03-motion_files/03-motion_28_0.png)
    
The arguments to `plt.plot` are `x`, `y`, and a string that specifies
the style.  In this case, the letters `ko` indicate that we want a
black, round marker (`k` is for black because `b` is for blue).
The functions `xlabel` and `ylabel` put labels on the axes.

Looking at this plot, we can see that the region we selected, which is
a rectangle in GD-1 coordinates, is a non-rectanglar region in ICRS
coordinates.

However, this scatter plot has a problem.  It is
"[overplotted](https://python-graph-gallery.com/134-how-to-avoid-overplotting-with-python/)",
which means that there are so many overlapping points, we can't
distinguish between high and low density areas.

To fix this, we can provide optional arguments to control the size and
transparency of the points.

> ## Exercise (5 minutes)
> 
> In the call to `plt.plot`, use the keyword argument `markersize` to

> 
> Then add the keyword argument `alpha` to make the markers partly transparent.

## Transform back

Remember that we selected data from a rectangle of coordinates in the
GD-1 frame, then transformed them to ICRS when we
constructed the query.
The coordinates in the query results are in ICRS.

To plot them, we will transform them back to the GD-1 frame;
that way, the axes of the figure are aligned with the orbit of GD-1,
which is useful for two reasons:

* By transforming the coordinates, we can identify stars that are
likely to be in GD-1 by selecting stars near the centerline of the
stream, where φ<sub>2</sub> is close to 0.

* By transforming the proper motions, we can identify stars with 
non-zero proper motion along the φ<sub>1</sub> axis, which are likely to be part of GD-1.

To do the transformation, we will put the results into a `SkyCoord`
object.  In a previous episode, we created a `SkyCoord` object like
this:

~~~
skycoord = SkyCoord(ra=results['ra'], dec=results['dec'])
~~~
{: .language-python}

Notice that we did not specify the reference frame. That is because when 
using `ra` and `dec` in `SkyCoord`, the `ICRS` frame is assumed by default.

The `SkyCoord` object can keep track not just of location, but also proper motions. 
This means that we can initialize a `SkyCoord` object with location and proper motions, 
then use all of these quantities together to transform into the GD-1 frame.
 
Now we are going to do something similar, but now we will take advantage of the `SkyCoord` object's 
capacity to include and track space motion information in addition to `ra` and
`dec`. We will now also include:

* `pmra` and `pmdec`, which are proper motion in the `ICRS` frame, and

* `distance` and `radial_velocity`, which are important for the reflex correction and will be discussed in that section.

~~~
distance = 8 * u.kpc
radial_velocity= 0 * u.km/u.s

skycoord = SkyCoord(ra=polygon_results['ra'], 
                    dec=polygon_results['dec'],
                    pm_ra_cosdec=polygon_results['pmra'],
                    pm_dec=polygon_results['pmdec'], 
                    distance=distance, 
                    radial_velocity=radial_velocity)
~~~
{: .language-python}

For the first four arguments, we use columns from `polygon_results`.

For `distance` and `radial_velocity` we use constants, which we explain in the section on reflex correction.

The result is an Astropy `SkyCoord` object, which we can transform to
the GD-1 frame.

~~~
transformed = skycoord.transform_to(gd1_frame)
~~~
{: .language-python}

The result is another `SkyCoord` object, now in the GD-1 frame.

## Reflex Correction

The next step is to correct the proper motion measurements for the
effect of the motion of our solar system around the Galactic center.

When we created `skycoord`, we provided constant values for `distance`
and `radial_velocity` rather than measurements from Gaia.

That might seem like a strange thing to do, but here is the motivation:

* Because the stars in GD-1 are so far away, parallaxes measured by Gaia 
are negligible, making the distance estimates unreliable.  
So we replace them with our current best estimate of the mean distance to
GD-1, about 8 kpc.  See [Koposov, Rix, and Hogg,
2010](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...712..260K/abstract).

* For the other stars in the table, this distance estimate will be
inaccurate, so reflex correction will not be correct.  But that should
have only a small effect on our ability to identify stars with the
proper motion we expect for GD-1.

* The measurement of radial velocity has no effect on the correction
for proper motion, but we have to provide a value to avoid errors in
the reflex correction calculation.  So we provide `0` as an arbitrary
place-keeper.

With this preparation, we can use `reflex_correct` from Gala
([documentation
here](https://gala-astro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/gala.coordinates.reflex_correct.html))
to correct for the motion of the solar system.

~~~
from gala.coordinates import reflex_correct

skycoord_gd1 = reflex_correct(transformed)
~~~
{: .language-python}

The result is a `SkyCoord` object that contains 

* `phi1` and `phi2`, which represent the transformed coordinates in
the GD-1 frame.

* `pm_phi1_cosphi2` and `pm_phi2`, which represent the transformed proper motions that have been corrected for the motion of the solar system around the Galactic center.

We can select the coordinates and plot them like this:

~~~
x = skycoord_gd1.phi1
y = skycoord_gd1.phi2
plt.plot(x, y, 'ko', markersize=0.1, alpha=0.1)

plt.xlabel('phi1 (degree GD1)')
plt.ylabel('phi2 (degree GD1)')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
<Figure size 432x288 with 1 Axes>
~~~
{: .output}
   
![Scatter plot of phi1 versus phi2 in GD-1 coordinates, showing selected region is rectangular.](../fig/03-motion_files/03-motion_43_0.png)

We started with a rectangle in the GD-1 frame.  When
transformed to the ICRS frame, it is a non-rectangular region.  Now,
transformed back to the GD-1 frame, it is a rectangle again.

## Pandas DataFrame

At this point we have two objects containing different subsets of the
data.  `polygon_results` is the Astropy `Table` we downloaded from Gaia.

~~~
type(polygon_results)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
astropy.table.table.Table
~~~
{: .output}

And `skycoord_gd1` is a `SkyCoord` object that contains the
transformed coordinates and proper motions.

~~~
type(skycoord_gd1)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
astropy.coordinates.sky_coordinate.SkyCoord
~~~
{: .output}

On one hand, this division of labor makes sense because each object
provides different capabilities.  But working with multiple object
types can be awkward. It will be more convenient to choose one object and get all of the
data into it.  

Now we can extract the columns we want from `skycoord_gd1` and add
them as columns in the Astropy `Table` `polygon_results`.  `phi1` and `phi2` contain the
transformed coordinates.

~~~
polygon_results['phi1'] = skycoord_gd1.phi1
polygon_results['phi2'] = skycoord_gd1.phi2
polygon_results.info()
~~~

It is straightforward to convert an Astropy `Table` to a Pandas `DataFrame`.

~~~
import pandas as pd

results_df = polygon_results.to_pandas()

`DataFrame` provides `shape`, which shows the number of rows and columns.

It also provides `head`, which displays the first few rows.  `head` is
useful for spot-checking large results as you go along.

Before we go any further, we will take all of the steps that we have done 
and consolidate them into a single function that we can use to take the
coordinates and proper motion that we get as an Astropy `Table` from our 
Gaia query, add columns representing the reflex corrected 
GD-1 coordinates and proper motions, and transform it into a 
Pandas `DataFrame`.
This is a general function that we will use multiple times as we build different
queries so we want to write it once and then call the function rather than having 
to copy and paste the code over and over again.

One of the most useful of these functions is `describe`, which
computes summary statistics for each column.

## Plot proper motion

Now we are ready to replicate one of the panels in Figure 1 of the
Price-Whelan and Bonaca paper, the one that shows components of proper
motion as a scatter plot:

<img width="300"
src="https://github.com/datacarpentry/astronomy-python/raw/gh-pages/fig/gd1-1.png" alt="Scatter of proper motion phi1 versus phi2 showing overdensity in negative proper motions of GD-1 stars.">

In this figure, the shaded area identifies stars that are likely to be
in GD-1 because:

* Due to the nature of tidal streams, we expect the proper motion for
stars in GD-1 to be along the axis of the stream; that is, we expect
motion in the direction of `phi2` to be near 0.

* In the direction of `phi1`, we don't have a prior expectation for
proper motion, except that it should form a cluster at a non-zero
value.

By plotting proper motion in the GD-1 frame, we hope to find this cluster.
Then we will use the bounds of the cluster to select stars that are
more likely to be in GD-1.

The following figure is a scatter plot of proper motion, in the GD-1
frame, for the stars in `results_df`.

~~~
x = results_df['pm_phi1']
y = results_df['pm_phi2']
plt.plot(x, y, 'ko', markersize=0.1, alpha=0.1)
    
plt.xlabel('Proper motion phi1 (mas/yr GD1 frame)')
plt.ylabel('Proper motion phi2 (mas/yr GD1 frame)')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
{: .output}
 
![Scatter plot of proper motion in GD-1 frame of selected stars showing most are near the origin.](../fig/03-motion_files/03-motion_67_0.png)

Most of the proper motions are near the origin, but there are a few
extreme values.
Following the example in the paper, we will use `xlim` and `ylim` to
zoom in on the region near the origin.

~~~
x = results_df['pm_phi1']
y = results_df['pm_phi2']
plt.plot(x, y, 'ko', markersize=0.1, alpha=0.1)
    
plt.xlabel('Proper motion phi1 (mas/yr GD1 frame)')
plt.ylabel('Proper motion phi2 (mas/yr GD1 frame)')

plt.xlim(-12, 8)
plt.ylim(-10, 10)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
<Figure size 432x288 with 1 Axes>
~~~
{: .output}
    
![Zoomed in view of previous scatter plot showing overdense region.](../fig/03-motion_files/03-motion_69_0.png)

There is a hint of an overdense region near (-7.5, 0), but if you
didn't know where to look, you would miss it.

To see the cluster more clearly, we need a sample that contains a
higher proportion of stars in GD-1.
We will do that by selecting stars close to the centerline.

## Selecting the centerline

As we can see in the following figure, many stars in GD-1 are less
than 1 degree from the line `phi2=0`.

![Scatter plot with selection on proper motion and photometry showing many stars in GD-1 are within 1 degree of phi2 = 0.](../fig/gd1-4.png)

Stars near this line have the highest probability of being in GD-1.

To select them, we will use a "Boolean mask".  We wil start by
selecting the `phi2` column from the `DataFrame`:

~~~
phi2 = results_df['phi2']
type(phi2)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
pandas.core.series.Series
~~~
{: .output}

The result is a `Series`, which is the structure Pandas uses to
represent columns.

We can use a comparison operator, `>`, to compare the values in a
`Series` to a constant.

~~~
phi2_min = -1.0 * u.degree
phi2_max = 1.0 * u.degree

mask = (phi2 > phi2_min)
type(mask)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
pandas.core.series.Series
~~~
{: .output}

The result is a `Series` of Boolean values, that is, `True` and `False`. 

~~~
mask.head()
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
0    False
1    False
2    False
3    False
4    False
Name: phi2, dtype: bool
~~~
{: .output}

To select values that fall between `phi2_min` and `phi2_max`, we'll
use the `&` operator, which computes "logical AND".
The result is true where elements from both Boolean `Series` are true.

~~~
mask = (phi2 > phi2_min) & (phi2 < phi2_max)
~~~
{: .language-python}

> ## Logical operators
> Python's logical operators (`and`, `or`, and `not`)
> don't work with NumPy or Pandas.  Both libraries use the bitwise
> operators (`&`, `|`, and `~`) to do elementwise logical operations

{: .callout}

The sum of a Boolean `Series` is the number of `True` values, so we
can use `sum` to see how many stars are in the selected region.

~~~
mask.sum()
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
25084
~~~
{: .output}

A Boolean `Series` is sometimes called a "mask" because we can use it
to mask out some of the rows in a `DataFrame` and select the rest,
like this:

~~~
centerline_df = results_df[mask]
type(centerline_df)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
pandas.core.frame.DataFrame
~~~
{: .output}

`centerline_df` is a `DataFrame` that contains only the rows from
`results_df` that correspond to `True` values in `mask`.
So it contains the stars near the centerline of GD-1.

We can use `len` to see how many rows are in `centerline_df`:

~~~
len(centerline_df)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
25084
~~~
{: .output}

And what fraction of the rows we have selected.

~~~
len(centerline_df) / len(results_df)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
0.1787386257562046
~~~
{: .output}

There are about 25,000 stars in this region, about 18% of the total.

## Plotting proper motion

This is the second time we are plotting proper motion, and we can imagine we might do it a few more times. Instead of copying
and pasting the previous code, we will write a function that we can reuse on any dataframe.

~~~
def plot_proper_motion(df):
    """Plot proper motion.
    
    df: DataFrame with `pm_phi1` and `pm_phi2`
    """
    x = df['pm_phi1']
    y = df['pm_phi2']
    plt.plot(x, y, 'ko', markersize=0.3, alpha=0.3)

    plt.xlabel('Proper motion phi1 (mas/yr)')
    plt.ylabel('Proper motion phi2 (mas/yr)')

    plt.xlim(-12, 8)
    plt.ylim(-10, 10)
~~~
{: .language-python}

And we can call it like this:

~~~
plot_proper_motion(centerline_df)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
<Figure size 432x288 with 1 Axes>
~~~
{: .output}
   
![Scatter plot of proper motion of selected stars showing cluster near (-7.5, 0).](../fig/03-motion_files/03-motion_92_0.png)

Now we can see more clearly that there is a cluster near (-7.5, 0).

You might notice that our figure is less dense than the one in the
paper.  That's because we started with a set of stars from a
relatively small region.  The figure in the paper is based on a region
about 10 times bigger.

In the next episode we will go back and select stars from a larger
region.  But first we will use the proper motion data to identify stars
likely to be in GD-1.

## Filtering based on proper motion

The next step is to select stars in the "overdense" region of proper
motion, which are candidates to be in GD-1.

In the original paper, Price-Whelan and Bonaca used a polygon to cover
this region, as shown in this figure.

<img width="300"
src="https://github.com/datacarpentry/astronomy-python/raw/gh-pages/fig/gd1-1.png" alt="Scatter plot of proper motion with overlaid polygon showing overdense region selected for analysis in Price-Whelan and Bonaca paper.">

We will use a simple rectangle for now, but in a later lesson we will see
how to select a polygonal region as well.

Here are bounds on proper motion we chose by eye:

~~~
pm1_min = -8.9
pm1_max = -6.9
pm2_min = -2.2
pm2_max =  1.0
~~~
{: .language-python}

To draw these bounds, we will use the `make_rectangle` function we wrote in episode 2 to make two lists containing the coordinates of the corners of the rectangle.

~~~
pm1_rect, pm2_rect = make_rectangle(
    pm1_min, pm1_max, pm2_min, pm2_max)
~~~
{: .language-python}

Here is what the plot looks like with the bounds we chose.

~~~
plot_proper_motion(centerline_df)
plt.plot(pm1_rect, pm2_rect, '-')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
<Figure size 432x288 with 1 Axes>
~~~
{: .output}
   
![Scatter plot of proper motion with blue box showing overdense region selected for our analysis.](../fig/03-motion_files/03-motion_100_0.png)

Now that we have identified the bounds of the cluster in proper motion,
we will use it to select rows from `results_df`.

We will use the following function, which uses Pandas operators to make
a mask that selects rows where `series` falls between `low` and
`high`.

~~~
def between(series, low, high):
    """Check whether values are between `low` and `high`."""
    return (series > low) & (series < high)
~~~
{: .language-python}

The following mask selects stars with proper motion in the region we chose.

~~~
pm1 = results_df['pm_phi1']
pm2 = results_df['pm_phi2']

pm_mask = (between(pm1, pm1_min, pm1_max) & 
           between(pm2, pm2_min, pm2_max))
~~~
{: .language-python}

Again, the sum of a Boolean series is the number of `TRUE` values.

~~~
pm_mask.sum()
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
1049
~~~
{: .output}

Now we can use this mask to select rows from `results_df`.

~~~
selected_df = results_df[pm_mask]
len(selected_df)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
1049
~~~
{: .output}

These are the stars we think are likely to be in GD-1.  We can 
inspect these stars, plotting their coordinates (not their proper motion).

~~~
x = selected_df['phi1']
y = selected_df['phi2']
plt.plot(x, y, 'ko', markersize=1, alpha=1)

plt.xlabel('phi1 (degree GD1)')
plt.ylabel('phi2 (degree GD1)')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
<Figure size 432x288 with 1 Axes>
~~~
{: .output}
   
![Scatter plot of coordinates of stars in selected region, showing tidal stream.](../fig/03-motion_files/03-motion_110_0.png)

Now that is starting to look like a tidal stream!

To clean up the plot a little bit we can add two new Matplotlib commands:
* `axis` with the parameter `equal` sets up the axes so a unit is the
same size along the `x` and `y` axes.

* `title` puts the input string as a title at the top of the plot. The `fontsize` keyword 
sets the `fontsize` to be `medium`, a little smaller than the default `large`.

In an example like this, where `x` and `y` represent coordinates in
space, equal axes ensures that the distance between points is
represented accurately. Since we are now constraining the relative proportions
of our axes, the data may not fill the entire figure.

~~~
x = selected_df['phi1']
y = selected_df['phi2']

plt.plot(x, y, 'ko', markersize=0.3, alpha=0.3)

plt.xlabel('phi1 [deg]')
plt.ylabel('phi2 [deg]')
plt.title('Proper motion selection', fontsize='medium')

plt.axis('equal')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
<Figure size 432x288 with 1 Axes>
~~~
{: .output}

![Scatter plot of coordinates of stars in selected region, showing tidal stream with equally proportioned axes.](../fig/03-motion_files/03-motion_plot_pm_selection.png)

Before we go any further, we will put the code we wrote to make one of the panel
figures into a function that we will use in future episodes to recreate this 
entire plot with a single line of code.

~~~
def plot_pm_selection(df):
    """Plot in GD-1 spatial coordinates the location of the stars
    selected by proper motion
    """
    x = df['phi1']
    y = df['phi2']

    plt.plot(x, y, 'ko', markersize=0.3, alpha=0.3)

    plt.xlabel('phi1 [deg]')
    plt.ylabel('phi2 [deg]')
    plt.title('Proper motion selection', fontsize='medium')

    plt.axis('equal')
~~~
{: .language-python}

Now our one line plot command is:
~~~
plot_pm_selection(selected_df)
~~~
{: .language-python}


## Saving the DataFrame

At this point we have run a successful query and cleaned up the
results. This is a good time to save the data.

To save a Pandas `DataFrame`, one option is to convert it to an
Astropy `Table`, like this:

~~~
from astropy.table import Table

selected_table = Table.from_pandas(selected_df)
type(selected_table)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
astropy.table.table.Table
~~~
{: .output}

Then we could write the `Table` to a FITS file, as we did in the
previous lesson.

But Pandas provides functions to write DataFrames in other formats; to
see what they are [find the functions here that begin with
`to_`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html).

One of the best options is HDF5, which is Version 5 of [Hierarchical
Data Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format).

HDF5 is a binary format, so files are small and fast to read and write
(like FITS, but unlike XML).

An HDF5 file is similar to an SQL database in the sense that it can
contain more than one table, although in HDF5 vocabulary, a table is
called a Dataset.  ([Multi-extension FITS
files](https://www.stsci.edu/itt/review/dhb_2011/Intro/intro_ch23.html)
can also contain more than one table.)

And HDF5 stores the metadata associated with the table, including
column names, row labels, and data types (like FITS).

Finally, HDF5 is a cross-language standard, so if you write an HDF5
file with Pandas, you can read it back with many other software tools
(more than FITS).

We can write a Pandas `DataFrame` to an HDF5 file like this:

~~~
filename = 'gd1_data.hdf'

selected_df.to_hdf(filename, 'selected_df', mode='w')
~~~
{: .language-python}

Because an HDF5 file can contain more than one Dataset, we have to
provide a name, or "key", that identifies the Dataset in the file.

We could use any string as the key, but it is generally a good practice
to use a descriptive name (just like your `DataFrame` variable name) so 
 we will give the Dataset in the file the same name (key) as the `DataFrame`.

By default, writing a `DataFrame` appends a new dataset to an existing HDF5 file.
 We will use the argument `mode='w'` to overwrite the 
file if it already exists rather than append another dataset to it.

> ## Exercise (5 minutes)
> 
> We are going to need `centerline_df` later as well.  Write a line of
> code to add it as a second Dataset in the HDF5 file.

> > ## Solution

> > ~~~

> > ~~~
> > {: .language-python}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

We can use `getsize` to confirm that the file exists and check the size.
`getsize` returns a value in bytes. For the size files we're looking at, it will
be useful to view their size in MegaBytes (MB), so we will divide by 1024*1024.

~~~
from os.path import getsize

MB = 1024 * 1024
getsize(filename) / MB
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
2.2084197998046875
~~~
{: .output}

If you forget what the names of the Datasets in the file are, you can
read them back like this:

~~~
with pd.HDFStore(filename) as hdf:
    print(hdf.keys())
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
['/centerline_df', '/selected_df']
~~~
{: .output}

> ## Context Managers
> We use a `with` statement here to open the file
> before the print statement and (automatically) close it after.  Read
> more about [context managers](https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/context_managers.html).
{: .callout}

The keys are the names of the Datasets which makes it easy for us to remember which `DataFrame` is
in which Dataset.

## Summary

In this episode, we re-loaded the Gaia data we saved from a previous query.

We transformed the coordinates and proper motion from ICRS to a frame
aligned with the orbit of GD-1, and stored the results in a Pandas
`DataFrame`.

Then we replicated the selection process from the Price-Whelan and Bonaca paper:

* We selected stars near the centerline of GD-1 and made a scatter
plot of their proper motion.

* We identified a region of proper motion that contains stars likely
to be in GD-1.

* We used a Boolean `Series` as a mask to select stars whose proper
motion is in that region.

So far, we have used data from a relatively small region of the sky.
In the next lesson, we will write a query that selects stars based on
proper motion, which will allow us to explore a larger region.
